# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first completely independent project!  Uses magic squares to check for 3-in-a-row's.

I programed this over the weekend, because I was bored, and wanted a beginner project to practice what I had learned in Javascript tutorials.  

Its a pretty small program, that uses an inefficient algorithm, now that I look back in retrospect. 

Figuring out the details of the for loops I used was actually quite difficult and time consuming.  

It would have just been easier to list out the cases (as there are only a few ways to win Tic-Tac-Toe).

But at the same time, this was a good learning experience.  

Play a few games versus yourself here!  

I might try to figure out an AI for this sooner or later.
